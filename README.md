This Repo contains a small program to help me: Launch Chrome with my  school tabs, open my IDE's, and open a templated word DOC. The program uses CMD for the backend and Java Swing for the front endx


**NOTE** This program at the moment will only work with my personal computer, I intend on refactoring my code to allow for calls to the windows registry, which in turn would allow this program to work on anyone's windows machine.
